I'm Marcelo Falchi, a software engineer working at [Oniun ERP](https://www.oniun.com.br/) to make software work in real-life. I previously I worked as a software developer at [Gew Tecnologia](https://www.gew.com.br/).

I graduated from The [Federal Technological University of Paraná](https://www.utfpr.edu.br/), with a technologist's degree in Analysis and systems development with an Excellent with honors grade.

In my free time, I play online games & go to the gym. Fun fact, My [technologist thesis](https://github.com/Falchizao/scarletgraph_client) was about a social network offering job vacancies, but with the difference of being only for women. It has some automatic portfolio generation features, chat system, connection with other users and much more, all using Flutter, Firebase and Java.

Summer 2014, I spent 1 month in the UK, Italy and France as a part of culture exchange program, where I studied english at [Newbold College](https://www.newbold.ac.uk/). (was really fun)!

I’m best reached through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/falchizao/). I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.

By the way, here is my [Resume](/assets/img/Resume_MarceloFalchi.pdf).

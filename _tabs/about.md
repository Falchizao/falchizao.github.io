I'm Marcelo Falchi, I pursued Computer Systems Analyst at a prestigious Brazilian Federal school [Federal Technological University of Paraná](https://www.utfpr.edu.br/), complemented by postgraduate studies in Computer Networks. 

Additionally I have more than 3 years of experience in WEB and Mobile development.

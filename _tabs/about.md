I'm Marcelo Falchi, a Software Engineer working at [Oniun ERP](https://www.oniun.com.br/). I previously I worked as a Software Developer at [Gew Tecnologia](https://www.gew.com.br/).

I graduated from The [Federal Technological University of Paraná](https://www.utfpr.edu.br/), with a technologist's degree in Analysis and systems development with an Excellent with honors grade.

I participated in an extension project called 'DASS Scale' at the [State University of West Paraná](https://www.unioeste.br), with the scope of calculating and disseminating psychological results in the field of Medicine, providing support to professionals in the field, and gaining extensive experience in mobile application development.

In my free time, I play online games & go to the gym. Fun fact, My [technologist thesis](https://github.com/Falchizao/scarletgraph_client) was about a social network offering job vacancies, but with the difference of being only for women. It has some automatic portfolio generation features, chat system, connection with other users and much more, all using Flutter, Firebase and Java.

Summer 2014, I spent 1 month in the UK, Italy and France as a part of culture exchange program, where I studied english at [Newbold College](https://www.newbold.ac.uk/). (was really fun)!

Fall 2017, I went to Peru with my dad, where we visited [Machu Picchu](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu), [Rainbow Montain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinicunca) and Local Villages. (and before you guys ask, yes, we ate Cuy).

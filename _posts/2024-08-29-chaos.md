# Introduction

Chaos Engineering is a practice that aims to test and improve the resilience and robustness of distributed systems by deliberately introducing failures into production environments and observing how the system reacts to these failures. 

The main idea is to anticipate real-world problems by simulating adverse and unexpected conditions to ensure that the system can continue to function even in the event of a failure.

The approach has been popularized by companies such as Netflix, which has developed tools such as “Chaos Monkey” to randomly shut down parts of its infrastructure in production, ensuring that the system continues to function even under adverse conditions.

## Chaos Engineering Fundamentals

Chaos Engineering is based on the idea that complex, distributed systems will inevitably experience failures. Rather than avoiding failures, it focuses on ensuring that the system can handle them effectively, minimizing their impact.

Unlike traditional testing, which is typically performed in development or test environments, Chaos Engineering conducts experiments directly in production environments. This ensures that the test conditions are realistic and truly reflect how the system will behave in the real world.

After each chaos experiment, teams analyze the results to identify weaknesses in the system. Lessons learned are then used to harden the system by fixing vulnerabilities and improving resilience.

## Benefits of Chaos Engineering

Improved resilience, reduced impacts of failures, greater confidence in infrastructure and addition of a culture of continuous improvement.

Some of the tools used in the practice of chaos engineering that can be mentioned are: Gremlin, Chaos Monkey (Netflix), Chaos Toolkit (Netflix), Kube-Monkey, Pumba and others.

## Types of Testing

Chaos Engineering involves performing various types of tests that simulate different types of failures and adverse conditions in distributed systems. 

Here are some of the most common types of testing performed in Chaos Engineering:

## Infrastructure Failure Tests

Shutting down server instances (e.g., with Chaos Monkey).

Description: These tests simulate the failure of infrastructure components, such as servers, virtual machines, or containers, to verify that the system can recover automatically and continue to operate without significant interruption.

## Network Failure Tests

Introducing latency, packet loss, or disconnections (e.g., with Toxiproxy).

Description: These tests simulate network issues, such as high latency, jitter, packet loss, or disconnections. The goal is to verify that the system can continue to function properly under adverse network conditions.

## External Dependency Failure Tests

Simulating the unavailability of an external API or database service.

Description: These tests involve simulating failures in external services that the system depends on, such as third-party APIs, databases, or authentication services. The goal is to ensure that the system can gracefully handle the failure of these dependencies.

## Internal Component Failure Tests

Shutting down individual microservices (e.g., with Pumba).

Description: These tests simulate the failure of internal system components, such as specific microservices, to assess the system's ability to continue functioning or to isolate the failure without impacting the end-user experience.

## Resource Failure Tests

Exhausting CPU, memory, or disk space (e.g., with Gremlin).

Description: These tests force the exhaustion of specific system resources, such as CPU, memory, or disk space, to verify how the system behaves under stress conditions and whether it can recover or scale as needed.

## Datacenter Failover Tests

Simulating the loss of an entire datacenter (e.g., with Chaos Kong).

Description: These tests simulate the loss of an entire data center or cloud region to ensure that the system can failover to another location without significant service interruptions.

## Security Failure Tests

Simulating denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Description: These tests simulate security attacks, such as denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or intrusion attempts, to assess the resilience of the system against security threats and verify that it can continue to operate under attack.

## Artificial Latency Tests

Introducing delay in inter-service communications.

Description: These tests involve introducing artificial latency into internal system communications, such as between microservices, to test the resilience of the system under slow response conditions.

## Data Inconsistency Tests

Introducing corruption or delay in data replication.

Description: These tests simulate situations where data may become inconsistent, such as delays in replication between databases, to assess how the system handles inconsistent or outdated data. 10. Traffic Overload Testing

## Traffic Overload Testing

Simulating unexpected traffic spikes (e.g. with Gremlin).

Description: These tests simulate an unusually high traffic load to see if the system can scale properly or if it fails under pressure, and how it handles queues or rate limiting.

## Rate Limiting Testing

Artificially limiting the number of requests a service can process.

Description: These tests simulate rate limiting on a service, to ensure that the system can gracefully degrade when rate limits are reached and that users receive appropriate responses (such as HTTP 429 codes).

## Rollback Testing

Testing the rollback of a simulated failure in a deployment or migration.

Description: These tests simulate failures in new software versions or data migrations, and verify the system's ability to roll back to a previous state without significant impact.

These are some of the main challenges and functions of ensuring an application with idempotent actions. However, it is important to note that the exact nature of the work may vary depending on the scope and complexity of the systems involved.

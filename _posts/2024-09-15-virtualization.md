## What is Virtualization?
Basically, Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based abstraction of physical resources, allowing systems to operate as if they were independent entities.

This technology can be applied to applications, servers, storage, and networks, enabling more efficient use of hardware.

It is considered one of the most effective ways to reduce IT costs while simultaneously enhancing efficiency and agility for businesses of all sizes.

## Principal Components

1.    Host: The host system, is the physical machine that runs the system or software designed to support virtual machines.
1.    Guest: The guest is a virtual machine running on the host system. Each guest operates as though it has exclusive access to a physical machine, creating the illusion of dedicated hardware for its use.
1.    Hypervisor: The hypervisor is the software layer that separates the operating system (OS) and applications from the underlying physical hardware. It runs directly on the machine's hardware, acting as an intermediary between the hardware and the OS.

## Benefits of Virtualization
1.  Creation of secure, customized, and isolated environments.
1.  Emulation/testing of separate execution environments.
1.  Running scalable and elastic systems.
1.  Automation of OS installation/configuration processes (Cloning, Appliance, etc.).
1.  Transparent migration of servers to new hardware.
1.  Increased availability and easier recovery in case of disasters.
1.  Full compatibility with applications.
1.  Ease of maintenance without service downtime.
